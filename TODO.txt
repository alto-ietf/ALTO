resource-id restrictions
RFC7285 section 10.2

double check PIDName restrictions

IRD: a used cost-type must exist

inheritance



===Notes===
1. TypedEndpointAddress (RFC7285, Sec. 10.4.1)
"ipv4:127.0.0.1" as a whole string. It is very difficult to model using YANG: "Type:Addr" where the Addr is inet-ip-address type.

Similar instances include "pid.endpoint-property-type" where the second half should be enum/restricted.

2. meta field should have the same format, use augment feature of YANG to encode it.

Issues: augment cannot remove data notes/structures; some meta fields require one vtag, some require a list of vtags (dependent-vtags).
