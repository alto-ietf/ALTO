default resource-id "my-default-network-map"

JSON map (the key can't be data node in YANG)

IRD: a used cost-type must exist

inheritance?

capabilities? and other optional entries

===Notes===

1. TypedEndpointAddress (RFC7285, Sec. 10.4.1).

"ipv4:127.0.0.1" as a whole string. It is very difficult to model
using YANG: "Type:Addr" where the Addr is inet-ip-address type.

Similar instances include "pid.endpoint-property-type" where the
second half should be enum/restricted.

2. meta field should have the same format, use augment feature of YANG
to encode it.

Issues: augment cannot remove data notes/structures; some meta fields
require one vtag, some require a list of vtags (dependent-vtags).

uses abc {
    refine port {
        default 80;
    }
}

3. 
for cost service/filtered-map service, use leaf-ref to restrict output pids
//can't seem to reference an rpc node.
