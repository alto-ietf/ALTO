IRD: a used cost-type must exist

namespace issues during rpc/rpc-reply validation
(in a (near) top-level array, ns must be include in every single node)

rpc input-output orders must be fixed

dealing with data inheritance and polymorphism arrays

===Notes===

2. meta field should have the same format, use augment feature of YANG
to encode it.

Issues: augment cannot remove data notes/structures; some meta fields
require one vtag, some require a list of vtags (dependent-vtags).

uses abc {
    refine port {
        default 80;
    }
}

3. restricting rpc reply
for cost service/filtered-map service, use leaf-ref to restrict output pids
//can't seem to reference an rpc node.

reply from netmod: Can't do this in YANG. Specify in description.
